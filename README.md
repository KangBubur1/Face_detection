This project demonstrates a face scan detection system using Next.js for the frontend, Flask and Python for the backend, and Firebase for data storage and authentication. Users can scan their faces, which are then detected and processed for authentication, access control, or entertainment purposes.

## Features

- **Face Scanning**: Users upload images with faces, which are then processed by the system.
- **Face Detection**: Advanced algorithms identify faces within uploaded images.
- **Authentication**: Firebase integration provides secure user authentication.
- **Real-time Updates**: Users receive live updates on the scanning process and results.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendered and statically generated web apps.
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python framework for building web applications.
- **Python**: Backend processing, including face detection and manipulation.
- **Firebase**: Google's app development platform for authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage.

## How To Run

Ensure you have Python 3.11 and Dlib 3.11 installed correctly. If using other versions, it may cause issues.

### Web Application

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Access the web application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend API

1. Navigate to the API directory:

    ```
    cd api
    ```

2. Run the Flask application:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```
